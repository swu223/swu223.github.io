# Fetch Data Exercise with React

This project features React components useEffect and useReduce to fetch data from a url and present it in a paginated list. We are using the Metropolitan Museum's public api, which can be found here: https://metmuseum.github.io/.

## Getting Started

Download the repository. Make sure you have http-server or an equivalent local server installed. React packages are included in index.html.

## Next Steps

Here are some planned improvements to the current project:

- add a search bar
- add a way to manage how many results can be shown on one page
