# Pacman Practice Project

This repository stores the code for the Pacman exercise from MITxPro's Module 4 from May 2023 cohort. The base code was made by Professor John Williams. In this project, Pac-man is set to move around the window and to change directions when the Pac-man image hits the edge of the window.

## Getting Started

You only need to download the repository and open the index.html file on your browser
to run the program.

## Next Steps

Here are some planned improvements to the current project:

- add a button to start pacman's motions
- have pacman's motion be in response to keyboard inputs
- add little lights for pacman to eat
