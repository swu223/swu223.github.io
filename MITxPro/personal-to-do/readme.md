 # Personal To-do List

This project utilizes React, the Formik library and JSX to create a to-do-list. With this project, you can add items onto the to-do list and delete items from the list. The to-do list also gives you a fun alert when you finish all your items.

## Getting Started

Download the repository. Make sure you have some kind of local-server hosting method if available. If you don't have, you can try to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server.

## Next Steps

Here are some planned improvements to the current project:

- Create some kind of intermediate state such that the to-do is crossed off but users have to explicitly delete it.
- Create some way to order the to-do list items such that completed items can be moved to the bottom of the list.
