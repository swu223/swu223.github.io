# Shopping Cart Exercise

Base code from MITxPRO course Module 19.
A user can add grocery items from the product list to their cart, remove items from their cart, view the total and check out. 
This is an exercise to use a Strapi database and to fetch data from the database to show on the DOM.

## Getting Started

You will need to:
1) clone this repository to your device. 
2) download Strapi. Please follow their instructions on their quick start guide: https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start and set up a collection with products with keys matching the ones in the product list of our cart.jsx.
3) install a local server to access the index.html. I used http-server
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server.
4) Run the local http-server and open the localhost:8080 on a browser inside the repository to open the index.html.

## Next Steps

Here are some planned improvements to the current project:

- better styling to the list, cart contents and checkout
- add more products from the database.
