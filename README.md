# swu223.github.io

This repository is meant to house Sarah's portfolio on the website: <https://swu223.github.io>.

This repository also acts as a storage of the class materials from MITxPRO 2023.

Used the following resources to attempt to deploy a Next.js file to github:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-next-js-app-to-github-pages/
  - Uses a custom next.js action file in addition to the publish.yml
https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
  - Instead of publish yml, uses "deploy.yml" and uses a built in next.js action file.

  # Next steps:
  Review how to deploy a github page with custom actions.
